PhotoDemo


Used SDKs:
Facebook
Parse

Created Framework:
PhotoDemoFramework

This app includes a custom framework, async image loading, page image loading on scroll, UICollectionView, and Facebook Parse, and Flickr Integration.

Facebook is reviewing the app to allow non test users to preview user images. In the mean time I have add Flickr so you can preview loading images async. 

I may have some missing use cases with the added complexity so I branched this version.
